# Solak_Sim-ASP.NET
ASP.NET page for the Solak Simulator

This was a learning personal project intended to learn the basics of ASP.NET.
It currently reads in a JSON File that displays Drop information for Runescapes "Solak" raid boss. Uses C#, HTML, and CSS.
On the simulation page, I used C# code to write a simulator that will simulate 1000 Solak completions and display information to the user.

Information Displayed includes: Broadcasts for all unique drops both personal and teamates, The ammount of all Commons and Unique Drops recieved, The value for all the drops, Log Completion(1 of each unique drop personally), and the total value of money earned per completion.


This ASP.NET page may or may not get updated in the future. I will likely test new techniques and all things I learn here.

Thanks,
  Jackson
